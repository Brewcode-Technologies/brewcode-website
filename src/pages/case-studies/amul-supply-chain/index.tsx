                  </h2>
                  <p className="section-description">
                    Amul, a leading dairy cooperative in India, faced challenges
                    in optimizing its vast supply chain network. With growing
                    demand for their products, delays in delivery and
                    inefficiencies in logistics management began to impact the
                    business. The manual tracking of deliveries resulted in
                    inaccurate data and an inability to predict delays or stock
                    shortages. This led to customer dissatisfaction, operational
                    bottlenecks, and increased costs. Additionally, Amul
                    struggled with coordinating multiple logistics partners,
                    causing inconsistencies in transportation and storage. The
                    lack of real-time visibility into the supply chain further
                    hindered their ability to make informed decisions.

                  <p className="section-description">
                    Amul's primary business goal was to streamline its supply
                    chain operations to ensure timely delivery of fresh dairy
                    products across the country. They aimed to reduce logistics
                    costs by optimizing routes and improving coordination with
                    their logistics partners. Another goal was to integrate a
                    digital solution that would provide real-time visibility
                    into the supply chain, enabling proactive management of
                    inventory and deliveries. By leveraging advanced logistics
                    technologies, Amul sought to enhance customer satisfaction,
                    reduce operational inefficiencies, and maintain product
                    freshness throughout the supply chain journey.
