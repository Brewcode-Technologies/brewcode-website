            This Cookie Policy explains how __________ (" Company ", " we", " us", and " our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites at https://brewcode.co , (" Websites"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

            What are cookies?
            </h5>
            <p className="privacy-notice-sub-heading-description">
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
            </p>
            <p className="privacy-notice-sub-heading-description">
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, __________) are
              called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than
              the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party
              cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
              provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising,
              interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these
              third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it
              visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
              other websites.

            <p className="privacy-notice-sub-heading-description">
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
              You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in
              the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you
              to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
              Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly
              necessary to provide you with services.

              <br />

              The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner
              and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still
              use our website though your access to some functionality and areas
              of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your
              web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by
              which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls
              vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help
              menu for more information.

            What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
            </h5>
            <p className="privacy-notice-sub-heading-description">
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
              website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
              like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear
              gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
              identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited
              our Websites or opened an e-mail including them . This allows us,
              for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one
              page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
              cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from
              an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
              improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail
              marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
              reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies
              will impair their functioning.

            <p className="privacy-notice-sub-heading-description">
            Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as
              Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect
              and store information about your use of our services, fraud
              prevention and for other site operations.

              <br />

              If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
              adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies
              storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings
              Panel . You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global
              Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may
              include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
              existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the
              Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on
              your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
              and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered
              by the operator of the page you are on at the time).

              <br />

              Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
              acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality
