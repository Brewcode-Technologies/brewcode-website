                  The education field, whether K-12 or higher education, private
                  or public, is facing a drastic change in how IT services are
                  consumed. IT administrators are facing an increased challenge
                  of creating and supporting a full-time online community in
                  environments that stretch from across the classroom to across
                  the globe. And all the while, IT leaders are also responsible
                  for student information security, including grades and
                  financial information.{" "}

                Compounding your challenge is the constant pressure on budget and funding. More needs must be met with less to satisfy deans and boards of educationsâ€”not to mention students and their families, and the surrounding community.
