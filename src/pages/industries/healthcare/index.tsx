                  Federal, state, EU, HIPAA, and Joint Commission regulations
                  have conspired to create a complex IT environment for the
                  entire healthcare industry. Whether it is a small community
                  hospital or an entity that is part of a large healthcare
                  network, all organizations must continuously balance their
                  mission of quality patient care while meeting shifting
                  compliance requirements. WEI provides the technology and
                  expertise to help you create an adaptive infrastructure to
                  meet the goals of patients, caregivers, and administrators.

                Shortening the time to implement a new initiative in the

                Adaptive Infrastructure solutions can lower time to market, or
                in this case time to treatment, from weeks to just minutes.
                Using virtualized scalable servers in conjunction with
                virtualized storage, virtualized I/O, and intuitive management
                software, templates can be created to provision for new
